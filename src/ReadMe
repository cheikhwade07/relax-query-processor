RELAX Demo – How to Run and Test

To start the RELAX console:
👉 Open your project, go to APP.main, and run it.
You should see the prompt:

RELAX-style console. Type :help ; for commands.
relax>


Now you can paste the commands below one by one to test all required operations.

Step 1. Define Relations
Employees (Name, Age, EmpDept) = {
  John, 32, HR
  Alice, 28, IT
  Bob, 29, IT
  Mary, 35, Finance
  Tom, 40, HR
};

Departments (DeptCode, Manager) = {
  HR, Smith
  IT, Clark
  Finance, Alice
};

Contractors (Name, Age, EmpDept) = {
  Anna, 30, IT
  Mark, 35, Sales
  Bob, 29, IT
  Tom, 40, HR
};

Step 2. Selection (σ)
σ Age > 30 (Employees);
select Age > 30 (Employees);

Step 3. Projection (π)
π Name, EmpDept (Employees);
project Name, EmpDept (Employees);

Step 4. Join (⋈ / ⨝ / join)
Employees join EmpDept=DeptCode Departments;
Employees ⨝ EmpDept=DeptCode Departments;

π Name, EmpDept, Manager (Employees join EmpDept=DeptCode Departments);

Step 5. Union (∪)
Employees ∪   Contractors;
Employees union Contractors;

Step 6. Intersection (∩)
Employees ∩ Contractors;
Employees intersect Contractors;

Step 7. Difference (−)
Employees − Contractors;
Employees - Contractors;
Employees difference Contractors;

Step 8. Nested Query Example
π Name (σ Age > 30 (Employees));

This selects employees older than 30 and then projects only their names.

✅ That’s it! With this walkthrough, you can test Selection, Projection, Join, Union, Intersection, and Difference .
